# MyNFT Project

## Overview

This project implements an ERC-721 compliant NFT smart contract named "MyNFT", allowing for the minting, transferring, and management of unique digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain. Each NFT points to metadata stored immutably on IPFS.

## Contract Functionalities

- **Minting**: Users can mint new NFTs, specifying a recipient address and the IPFS URI for the NFT's metadata.
- **Transferring**: NFT owners can transfer their assets to others in a safe manner.
- **Approvals**: Owners can approve other addresses to transfer their NFTs.

## How to Mint an NFT

1. Ensure you have a Rinkeby testnet account with ETH for transaction fees.
2. Use a Web3 wallet like MetaMask to interact with the contract.
3. Call the `mint` function with the recipient's address and the IPFS link to the NFT's metadata.
